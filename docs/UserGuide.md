## Data

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer by following the instructions in [Quick Start](#quick-start) and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.
1. Find the `data` folder created by the application
![FAQ 1 Step 1](./images/FAQ1Step1.png)
<br></br>
2. Transfer the `.json` file in the `data folder
![FAQ 1 Step 2](./images/FAQ1Step2.png)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known Issues

**Issue 1:** **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. <br>
**Remedy:** Delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application **in the same folder** before running the application again.
![Remedy for Known Issue 1](./images/KnownIssuesRemedy1.png)
<br></br>
**Issue 2:** **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear.<br> 
**Remedy:** Manually restore the minimized Help Window.
